[Intro]
I know what you're thinking
I've known it since you tuned in
You're thinking I CAN'T FREESTYLE RAP!
Well I've had it up to here with people assuming ogres can't break it down
SOMEBODY LAY DOWN A BEAT!

[Verse 1]
(I got a donkey who's wonky, yo)
Fee, fee, fi, fi, fo, fo, fun
Shrek ain't no average ogre, son
I got a donkey who's wonky and I live in the swamp
If you're feeling this ogre let me hear you stomp
Say Shrek, Shrek, oh, how'd you get so green?
Shrek, Shrek, yo, what's your favorite cuisine?
I eat frogs and bugs and dung beetle pie
Sometimes I eat my snot and I don't know why
Give me mud, be my bud, but don't be no dud
I be rocking this vest 'cause I'm original stud

[Verse 2]
Fee, fee, fi, fi, fo, fo, fum
Shrek ain't no average ogre, son
Three pigs, here's what, I build a house out of pain
And then I put Humpty back together again
Oh, Pinocchio's nose, it keeps on getting longer
But me and my donkey, we be getting stronger!
Tell Snow White and Red Riding Hood
Shrek's in town yo, he knows what's good
If you're looking for rhymes put away that map
Nothing's better than Shrek, 'cause this ogre, can rap!
